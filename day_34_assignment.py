What branch do you start on? How do you know?

Create a new branch called "feature".

Switch to the feature branch and work on this assignment. Everytime you make 
a meaningful change, commit that change with a useful commit message.

Now try to add, commit, and push your work. You should get an error message.
Copy/paste the error message (or specific pieces you don't quite understand)
into a search engine. Did you find any helpful explanations for the error 
message? (I recommend looking for highly upvoted responses on StackOverflow)
What does the error message mean? What should you do to push your work to GitHub?

After committing and pushing your work, log back into GitHub on your browser. Do
you see your commits? Can you see the history of your edits?
